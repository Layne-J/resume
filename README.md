# resume

Im setting this as my first publicly available resume of my work
The path to carreer chnage has been long and I think I'm ready to be not ready

The collection here will have some different langs and usecases including:
C++   Go    Python
Backend Development
Data Management
Basic Games to display language proficiency

They aren't great, but they work and I do too.
